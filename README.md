# Overview

Project Structure, Repositories and Branches: Each of the 5 project will have their own repositories. The branches will depend on the scope of each project and will be adjusted as the semester continues. 
Project 1's repository is called CMPG323_Overview_29652537 and is used to create a outline of all the activities for the semester.
Project 2 to 5 will all have their own repository code and branches.
Time will be allocated to each part of the projects depending on complexity.

The following branching strategy will be used in every project(Adjustments can be made depending on the scope of each project): GitHub Flow Branch Strategy will be used throughout each project and will contain 5 branches namely; Main, Hotfix, Develop, Feature and Release .This branching strategy will contain a main branch which only contains complete working code. The develop branch will be used to write code according to a projects requirments and will only be pushed to the main branch if all the code is working as intended. The feature and hotfix branches will be used to implement new features and to fix bugs, these fixes and features will only be pushed to the main branch if the code is working as intended.
All branches will be named descriptivley. 

Use of .gitignore file: This file will be placed in the root directory of each project, this file will be used for when a specific file leads to errors in already exisiting code.

As mentioned before the total number of repositories to be created will be 5, with each repository most likely also containing 5 branches acording to the branching strategy.

Storage of sensitive information: Only information that can't be used for ill intend will be availble to the public.
